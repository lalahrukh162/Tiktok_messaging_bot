🔥 TikTok Mass Messaging Automation Bot (Python + Selenium + Streamlit)

This project is a fully automated bot built using Python, Selenium, and Streamlit that allows users to:

Send **personalized messages** to a list of TikTok users
* Use a **Streamlit dashboard** for easy interface and control
* Run in **headless mode** for background execution
* Randomize message content and typing speed to mimic human behavior

💡 Features

🧠 Randomized typing and message variation to reduce spam detection
📂 CSV-based bulk upload for TikTok accounts and recipients
🧵 Multi-threading support for concurrent messaging across accounts
✅ Streamlit UI for user-friendly operation and monitoring
